Time-domain crossfade produces minor spectral thinning during transitions.

Spectral crossfade preserves harmonic continuity across frequency bins.

Audible difference is subtle but consistent with STFT visualization.

Spectral blending is most effective when segments are already compatible.

Confirms frequency-domain operations are meaningful post-selection.

Spectral crossfade is an optional enhancement, not a dependency
